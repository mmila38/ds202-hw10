# Load the accident data, plot latitude and longitude on a map.

```{r}

accident = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yumouqiu/DS202-Spring2022/main/Practice/data/fars2016/accident.csv")

accident.temp = accident %>% filter(LONGITUD < 750)
accident.temp %>% ggplot(aes(x = LONGITUD, y = LATITUDE)) + geom_point()
```

# Part 1

```{r}
# Are there some days of the week where more accidents happen?

accident %>% group_by(DAY_WEEK) %>% tally()
accident %>% ggplot(aes(x = DAY_WEEK)) + 
  xlab("Day of the Week") +
  geom_bar()

## It appears that the weekdays have fewer accidents than the weekends.

# What time of day do accidents happen?
accident.hour = accident %>% filter(HOUR <= 24) %>% group_by(HOUR) %>% summarise(n = n()) 
accident.hour %>% ggplot(aes(x = HOUR)) + geom_bar(aes(weight = n))

## What is the number of accidents with at least one drunk driver?

table(accident$DRUNK_DR)
